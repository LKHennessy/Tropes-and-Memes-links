Thank you to everyone who contributed to the Q and A (both questions and answers), please remind me of anything I've left out.

PS I am planing to refine the talk for Rails Girls so any constructive criticism is very welcome. Currently I plan to diversify the memes a little, flesh out the beginning to provide more context and extend the second half to provide more support and suggestions.

PPS my Github skills are embarrassing... please forgive me if this is a bit of a massacre .
