Thank you to everyone who contributed to the Q and A (both questions and answers), please remind me of anything I've left out.

There's also a bunch of awesome rescouces in these notes from a newbie chat held by Amanda Neumann at the Perth Rails Camp last year: https://gist.github.com/amanda08/0ac72de090dc6e243c79

PS I am planing to refine the talk for Rails Girls so any constructive criticism is very welcome. Currently I plan to diversify the memes a little, flesh out the beginning to provide more context and extend the second half to provide more support and suggestions.
